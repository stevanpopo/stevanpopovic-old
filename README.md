# Personal Website Custom Theme

I created a custom theme for my personal website. I have had the website, running on a Wordpress, for many years. It has a huge number of posts and content that I didn't want to lose or migrate so I chose to develop a unique Wordpress theme from scratch. This allowed me to create a project were the focus was on the front-end (HTML & CSS, Bulma framework, design) and dabble in a new back-end language (PHP).
